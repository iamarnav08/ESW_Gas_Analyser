## Working of MQ 2 sensor

Gases - LPG , CO , smoke

Concentration -> 30 - 500 ppm

Donor atoms (or oxygen vacancies) provide free electrons that can conduct electricity in the tin dioxide.
When the sensor is exposed to air, oxygen gets adsorbed on the surface and traps these donor electrons, reducing conductivity (increasing resistance).
When reducing gases (like methane or CO) are present, they react with the adsorbed oxygen, freeing the donor electrons and increasing the conductivity (lowering resistance).
The sensor measures these changes in resistance (conductivity), and the output voltage increases with the gas concentration because more electrons are available to flow as current.

## Working of MQ7 sensor

The MQ-7 sensor is designed to detect carbon monoxide (CO) using a tin dioxide (SnO₂) sensing element. It works by changing its electrical resistance when CO is present. In clean air, the sensor has high resistance, but when CO interacts with the SnO₂ surface, the resistance decreases.

A key feature of the MQ-7 is its cyclic heating process:

At high temperature (320°C), the sensor cleans itself by adsorbing oxygen molecules.
At low temperature (100°C), the sensor becomes sensitive to CO, reducing its resistance in the presence of CO.
The sensor outputs an analog signal proportional to the CO concentration, making it ideal for CO detectors due to its improved accuracy and selectivity.

## Specialized for CO Detection

MQ-7 is specifically designed to detect carbon monoxide (CO) with high sensitivity. It is fine-tuned through its cyclic heating process, which improves its selectivity for CO and helps reduce interference from other gases. The MQ-7 sensor employs a cyclic heating process, alternating between a high temperature (for cleaning) and a low temperature (for CO detection). This process makes the MQ-7 more selective to CO, reducing false positives from other gases like hydrogen or methane.
The MQ-7 sensor operates on a cyclic heating mechanism with two distinct temperature phases:

High-temperature phase (around 300°C to 350°C): During this phase, the sensor burns off impurities or other gases that may have adsorbed on the surface, ensuring that it is primed for CO detection.
Low-temperature phase (around 100°C to 150°C): This lower temperature is where CO is effectively detected. At this temperature, the CO molecules are adsorbed onto the SnO₂ surface, triggering the redox reaction and thus leading to a measurable change in resistance.

This temperature cycling is essential because it optimizes the sensor's selectivity for CO while minimizing interference from other gases.
Change in Electrical Resistance

## Change in electrical Resistance

As CO is oxidized on the SnO₂ surface, oxygen molecules that were previously adsorbed on the surface as O⁻ ions are released, leading to a reduction in the number of charge carriers trapped on the surface.
This release of oxygen increases the availability of free electrons in the SnO₂ material, leading to a decrease in resistance.
The change in resistance is directly proportional to the concentration of CO in the surrounding air, allowing the sensor to measure CO levels.
